# Song-Features-Over-Time
This project will take the metadata of tracks from spotify across 100 years to analyze how music has changed over time.

## Purpose

This topic was selected after exploring what data Spotify keeps on the music uploaded to its platform.
Spotify classifies music based on the following features:

* id (Id of track generated by Spotify)
* acousticness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* danceability (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* energy (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* duration_ms (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)
* instrumentalness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* valence (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* popularity (Ranges from 0 to 100)
* tempo (Float typically ranging from 50 to 150)
* liveness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* loudness (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0)
* speechiness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
* mode (0 = Minor, 1 = Major)
* explicit (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content)
* key (All keys on octave encoded as values ranging from 0 to 11, starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so onâ€¦)
* timesignature (The predicted timesignature, most typically 4)
* artists (List of artists mentioned)
* artists (Ids of mentioned artists)
* release_date (Date of release mostly in yyyy-mm-dd format, however precision of date may vary)
* name (Name of the song)

We're curious about how the ratio of these features has changed over time. Are any cyclical trends? How does the breakdown look for different genres, and can we find how new genres are created?
 
## Data Source
We are sourcing our data from the following dataset on Kaggle:
